## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* A messge in the win-builder check mentions the title including Chart.js. As I understand it this is the name of the library as listed on the [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org) website.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
